The code in this repo is organised by question.
IMPORTANT: the data for the provided dataset loader must live in a folder called data in the same directory as the question answers (this folder is not committed to this repo).

Run each notebook to test the code. Note model training takes a long time!

No extraordinary python libraries are used, just pytorch, numpy, matplotlib etc.

Best of luck,
Lennox.
